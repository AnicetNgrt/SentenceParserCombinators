# SentenceParserCombinators
Attempt at reimplenting Parser Combinators I learned to make in Rust in Java.

Parses a sentence consisting of one or more words separated by one or more whitespace characters, prohibiting extra whitespaces at the start or at the end.

Maybe I'll update later to force the first character to by uppercase and the last one to be a dot. With the current state of affairs it won't be too hard.
